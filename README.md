Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (yes or no) using demographic and behavioral data such as age, job, marital status, and past campaign outcomes. We use a Decision Tree Classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm that is easy to interpret and visualize.

Dataset
The Bank Marketing Dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information from direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Features: Age, Job, Marital Status, Education, Default, Balance, Housing Loan, Personal Loan, Contact Type, Duration, Campaign, PDays, Previous, and Outcome of Previous Campaign.
Target: y (Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit, 'yes' or 'no').

Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For building the Decision Tree Classifier.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

└── requirements.txt                    # Python package requirements
Data Preprocessing
Before building the model, the data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This involves:

Handling missing data: Ensuring that there are no missing values in crucial columns.
Encoding categorical features: Converting categorical variables (like job, marital status, education) into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Splitting the dataset: The data is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 or 70-30 ratio.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example of data splitting
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Model Building
We use the Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn to train the model on the Bank Marketing dataset. Key steps include:

Initializing the Decision Tree:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', max_depth=5, random_state=42)
Training the model:
python
Copy code
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation
After training the model, the following steps are taken to evaluate its performance:

Prediction:

python
Copy code
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
Accuracy and Classification Report:

Evaluate the accuracy of the model using accuracy score.
Generate a classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Confusion Matrix:

Visualize the confusion matrix to get insights into model performance.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
Visualizing the Decision Tree:

Visualize the trained Decision Tree to better understand its decision-making process.
python
Copy code
from sklearn import tree
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
tree.plot_tree(clf, filled=True, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=['No', 'Yes'], rounded=True)
plt.show()
